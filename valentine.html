                <p style="font-style: oblique;">Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine,[1] is celebrated annually on February 14.[2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring one or two early Christian martyrs named Saint Valentine and, through later folk traditions, has become a significant cultural, religious, and commercial celebration of romance and love in many regions of the world.[3]
                <br><br>
                There are a number of martyrdom stories associated with various Valentines connected to February 14,[4] including an account of the imprisonment of Saint Valentine of Rome for ministering to Christians persecuted under the Roman Empire in the third century.[5][6] According to an early tradition, Saint Valentine restored sight to the blind daughter of his jailer.[7] Numerous later additions to the legend have better related it to the theme of love: an 18th-century embellishment to the legend claims he wrote the jailer's daughter a letter signed "Your Valentine" as a farewell before his execution;[8] another addition posits that Saint Valentine performed weddings for Christian soldiers who were forbidden to marry.[6]
                <br><br>
                The Feast of Saint Valentine was established by Pope Gelasius I in AD 496 to be celebrated on February 14 in honour of Saint Valentine of Rome, who died on that date in AD 269.[9][10] The day became associated with romantic love in the 14th and 15th centuries when notions of courtly love flourished, apparently by association with the "lovebirds" of early spring. In 18th-century England, it grew into an occasion in which couples expressed their love for each other by presenting flowers, offering confectionery, and sending greeting cards (known as "valentines"). Valentine's Day symbols that are used today include the heart-shaped outline, doves, and the figure of the winged Cupid. Since the 19th century, handwritten valentines have given way to mass-produced greeting cards.[11] In Italy, Saint Valentine's Keys are given to lovers "as a romantic symbol and an invitation to unlock the giver's heart", as well as to children to ward off epilepsy (called Saint Valentine's Malady).[12]
                <br><br>
                Saint Valentine's Day is not a public holiday in any country, although it is an official feast day in the Anglican Communion[13] and the Lutheran Church.[14] Many parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church also celebrate Saint Valentine's Day on July 6 in honor of Roman presbyter Saint Valentine, and on July 30 in honor of Hieromartyr Valentine, the Bishop of Interamna (modern Terni).[15]</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                        <p style="font-style: oblique;"> Numerous early Christian martyrs were named Valentine.[16] The Valentines honored on February 14 are Valentine of Rome (Valentinus presb. m. Romae) and Valentine of Terni (Valentinus ep. Interamnensis m. Romae).[17] Valentine of Rome was a priest in Rome who was martyred in 269 and was added to the calendar of saints by Pope Gelasius I in 496 and was buried on the Via Flaminia. The relics of Saint Valentine were kept in the Church and Catacombs of San Valentino in Rome, which "remained an important pilgrim site throughout the Middle Ages until the relics of St. Valentine were transferred to the church of Santa Prassede during the pontificate of Nicholas IV".[18][19] The flower-crowned skull of Saint Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome. Other relics are found at Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland.[20]
                        <br><br>

                        Valentine of Terni became bishop of Interamna (now Terni, in central Italy) and is said to have been martyred during the persecution under Emperor Aurelian in 273. He is buried on the Via Flaminia, but in a different location from Valentine of Rome. His relics are at the Basilica of Saint Valentine in Terni (Basilica di San Valentino). Professor Jack B. Oruch of the University of Kansas notes that "abstracts of the acts of the two saints were in nearly every church and monastery of Europe."[21] The Catholic Encyclopedia also speaks of a third saint named Valentine who was mentioned in early martyrologies under date of February 14. He was martyred in Africa with a number of companions, but nothing more is known about him.[22] A relic claimed to be Saint Valentine of Terni's head was preserved in the abbey of New Minster, Winchester, and venerated.[23]
                        <br><br>
                        February 14 is celebrated as St. Valentine's Day in various Christian denominations; it has, for example, the rank of 'commemoration' in the calendar of saints in the Anglican Communion.[13] In addition, the feast day of Saint Valentine is also given in the calendar of saints of the Lutheran Church.[14] However, in the 1969 revision of the Roman Catholic Calendar of Saints, the feast day of Saint Valentine on February 14 was removed from the General Roman Calendar and relegated to particular (local or even national) calendars for the following reason: "Though the memorial of Saint Valentine is ancient, it is left to particular calendars, since, apart from his name, nothing is known of Saint Valentine except that he was buried on the Via Flaminia on February 14."[24]
                        <br><br>
                        The feast day is still celebrated in Balzan (Malta) where relics of the saint are claimed to be found, and also throughout the world by Traditionalist Catholics who follow the older, pre-Second Vatican Council calendar (see General Roman Calendar of 1960).
                        <br><br>
                        In the Eastern Orthodox Church, St. Valentine is recognized on July 6, in which Saint Valentine, the Roman presbyter, is honoured; in addition, the Eastern Orthodox Church observes the feast of Hieromartyr Valentine, Bishop of Interamna, on July 30.[25][26][27]

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Valentine's Day Gifts for Her</b></h2>
        <br>
        <p>Valentine's Day is a time to pull out all the stops for the woman you love most. Flower deliveries and heart-shaped chocolates are great and all, but they can come across — hate to say it — a little lazy. This year, go with one of these totally unique Valentine's Day gifts for her to shower your girlfriend, wife, daughter, mom or galentine with the kind of love she deserves.
            <br>
            As you browse through this list, consider what type of romantic gift will make her heart swell. If words of affirmation are her love language, pour your heart into the pages of a fill-in-the-blank book to remind her exactly what caught your eye way back when (and all the days since). Or if you want to make your bond even stronger, pick up a date-night bucket list and give her the best gift of all: quality time with the person she loves most (you!). No matter what you pick, all of these ideas will put your heart on display, especially if you opt for any of the one-of-a-kind Etsy gifts that you can personalize with thoughtful messages, cute couples photos or inside jokes.
            <br>
            If you're still recovering from holiday spending (we feel you), we've got you covered with tons of cheap Valentine's Day gifts (many can be ordered at the last-minute on Amazon) that will still earn you major brownie points.</p>

                    <h3><b>Flowers</b></h3>
                    <p>Every woman loves to receive flowers both on holidays and on a normal working day! But how do you know what flowers our women like?
                        <br>
                        Each flower carries magical information, it is hidden in color, shape and aroma. For example, pink flowers are considered universal flowers that may be suitable for a young girl or mature women. Many associate yellow flowers with parting, but this is not the case. Yellow recharges with a sunny mood, love of life and success. Many creative people choose yellow flowers. 
                        <br>
                        Red flowers will tell you about strong feelings, and rich burgundy will tell about strong passion. 
                        <br>
                        White flowers are a symbol of love, tenderness and purity of light. The flowers, combining several hues, will tell a diverse range of sensations.</p>

                <h3><b>Perfume</b></h3>
                <p>Perfume gift sets are the unsung hero of holiday gift giving. At first, fragrance may seem like a risky gift idea since it's so intensely personal, but a gift set of the recipient's favorite scent shows you actually know them better than anyone else out there.
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, if you're unsure of what they do like, a sample kit is almost like two gifts in one: They get the fragrances themselves, and the experience of discovering a brand-new signature scent. (No offense to Dolce & Gabbana's ubiquitous Light Blue, but it's nice to give a new perfume a chance to shine.)
                    <br>
                    Besides the fact that perfume feels so much more decadent and special than, say, a foundation or a mascara, most of the sets this season come in packaging so chic you don't even need to wrap them, and some are even paired with fragrance-infused skin-care products, like bodywash. So consider this our gift to you: We rounded up the best perfume gift sets you can't go wrong with. All you have to do is add to cart and throw on a pretty little bow.</p>
